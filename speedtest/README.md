# Speedtest Home Assistant Addon

Home Assistant has a native [integration with Speedtest.net](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/speedtestdotnet/). However, it uses a third-party speedtest implementation in python that may not produce accurate measures. This addon aims to integrate the [official speedtest binary](https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli) with Home Assistant to mitigate this problem.
